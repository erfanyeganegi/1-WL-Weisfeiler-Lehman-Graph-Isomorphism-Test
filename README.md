# The Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) Graph Isomorphism Test

This project is an educational exploration of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm. It was built to serve as a hands-on tool for myself and others to understand the step-by-step mechanics of the algorithm.

Since this is a learning exercise, the primary focus is on clarity and demonstration rather than creating a production-ready library. 🧑‍🏫
